## About Our Show

This show was born out of Michaela‚Äôs curiosity for how different companies develop software. How does their tech stack look like? Which practices do they follow? Do they do code reviews? Are the concerned about technical debt? And what about their culture and company values?

With this podcast Michaela wants to open doors at different companies, and get the perspective of experts in the fields about how to develop maintainable, reliable and scaleable software people love.

Michaela‚Äôs guests come from completely different backgrounds. Some come from large cooperation such as Microsoft, Google or Facebook. Some are founders of their own tech startup. And some come from more traditional or smaller businesses.

What they all have in common is a passion for high-quality software.

But how do they achieve their goal? As we all know, there isn‚Äôt only one way of developing quality-software. So, what best practices do they value, which management style do they prefer, and do they follow a certain software methodology. What problems do they struggle with? And which ones did they overcome already?

Let‚Äôs find out together in the Software Engineering Unlocked Podcast!
