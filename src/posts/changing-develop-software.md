In this episode, I talk to Tudor Gîrba, CEO and co-founder of Feenk, a software consultancy. Over the last 10 years, Tudor researched new ways to develop software – called moldable development. In this interview, I did deep to understand what that exactly means, and how he started to work on a novel IDE that enables moldable developments.

**We talk about:**

- how reading code slows down software productivity,
- building developer tools,
- starting your own software company,
- transitioning from consultancy to product company,
- and applied research.
