Natalie Davis, a recent Bootcamp graduate, shares how she managed to get hired right after graduating from a Bootcamp. She is vividly sharing her knowledge on Twitter and started to make real waves in the dev community within just one and a half years in tech.

**We talk about:**

- her experience at a developer Bootcamp,
- how she managed to quickly get hired after graduating,
- how she keeps up with all the stuff she has to learn,
- how she decides to adopt best practices,
- and how to overcome rejections by staying positive and focusing on growth.
