Jigyasa Grover, a machine learning engineer at Twitter, tells us about her successful career path through internships and research projects. Jigyasa is my first data engineer, and so it’s great to learn from her about what her day to day work entails. 

**We talk about:**

- what a machine learning engineer does,
- how to get started as a machine learning engineer,
- open source and Google’s summer of code projects,
- and her role at Facebook combing data and software engineering.
