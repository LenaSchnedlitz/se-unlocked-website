In this episode, I talk to Trisha Gee, who is the Lead of the Java Developer Advocacy Team at JetBrain. She is an expert for Java high-performance systems, and developed software for a variety of industries, such as finance or manufacturing.

**We talk about:**

- how she got started in tech,
- why it’s harder to read than write code,
- how it is to work at JetBrains,
- her hiring experiences,
- and how she overcame imposter syndrome and started to feel confident with her competences.
