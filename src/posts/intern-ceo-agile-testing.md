Alex Schladebeck, a testing expert and powerful voice in the tech community, shared how she transitioned from intern to CEO of a dev shop. Alex is the CEO of Bredex, a dev shop that offers tailor-made IT solutions but also specializes in quality assurance and testing.

A decade ago, Alex graduated in linguistic and came into tech by accident. So, I obviously have to ask her about her career transition, and testing.

**What we talk about:**

- transitioning into tech from a non-traditional background
- what it takes to get from an intern position to becoming the CEO
- which role testing plays at Bredex
- how mob or ensemble programming is used to facilitate learning
- how to lead remote software teams
