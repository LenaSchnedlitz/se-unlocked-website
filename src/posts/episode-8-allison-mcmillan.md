In this episode, Allison McMillan, a software engineering manager at Github joins me to talk about

- how she broke into tech from a non-traditional background,
- how she overcame obstacles and problems as a new mother in tech and
- how she builds herself a striving career.

As always, we also talk about software development methodologies such as code reviews and testing at Github. And surely, I pick her brain about remote work and her strategies to stay focused and happy in a remote setting.
