To celebrate the one year anniversary of the podcast, I tell you about my own journey into tech, and my experiences working at Microsoft and Microsoft Research. I share with you the turning points in my career and also how and why I started my own business.

**I talk about:**

- how I got into tech without any previous computer knowledge,
- how my dream of becoming a researcher in the industry became true,
- and why I transitioned to remote work.
- Finally, I talk about starting my own business because of the need for more flexibility to combine family and work.
