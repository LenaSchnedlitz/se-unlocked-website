In this episode, I talk to Annie Liew, who works as a web developer at a startup called Pastel. She transitioned from Design to Engineering, and I want to know how she experienced this.

**We talk about:**

- about her experience transitioning from Designer to Engineer,
- the role her Juno Web Development Bootcamp (formerly HackerYou),
- her new role as the first engineering hire at a startup,
- her drive to learn and level up in public,
- and how she managed to build a large Twitter following.
