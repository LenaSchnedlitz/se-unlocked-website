In this episode, I talk to Tomasz Łakomy, a senior frontend engineer at OLX Group. Tomasz is fascinated about teaching everything he knows and has over 170 video tutorials.

**We talk about:**

- how they develop, test, and reviews software at OLX group,
- what war rooms are and how they help to combat technical debt,
- how he managed to create over 170 video tutorials about software engineering,
- why he is AWS certified as a front-end engineer, and
- how skydiving helped him to be a better software developer.
