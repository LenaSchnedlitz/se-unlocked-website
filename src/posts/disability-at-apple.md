This episode is part 2 of my interview with Cher. In this part, we deep-dive into her interview experience at Apple and how she worked her way up to a Staff engineering position.

**We talk about:**

- the hiring process at Apple
- the tasks and responsibilities of a Staff engineer
- mental health, and bipolar disorder
- and how the “disability” box can be a life-changer when it comes to getting accommodations for your special needs.

Check-out also [part 1 of this interview](https://www.software-engineering-unlocked.com/from-hardship-to-apple/), in which Cher talks about how she overcame poverty and hardship.
