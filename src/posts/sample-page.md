On this page, you can learn more about what it means to be a guest on my show. The total time investment for a guest to record an episode of the Software Engineering Unlocked is **~1,5 hours**.

Step 1: Fill in the Starter Survey 👋
====================================

This survey helps me understand more about your background, and lets you highlight topics you would be excited to talk about.

Step 2: Prep for the recording 📝
================================

Choose a slot on the Podcast Episode calendar for us to record our episode!

I will do some additional research, including reading through your survey answers and read related articles/blog posts/talks/etc. Feel free to send me links to particular resources.

Step 3: Record the episode! 🎙
=============================

I will send you a custom link to a [Zencastr.com](https://squadcast.fm/) or SquadCast.com session, which we will use to record the episode. All you need is a modern browser; no accounts to create or software to install!

Plan to spend a max of 90 minutes for the recording; I anticipate episodes being ~60 minutes, so we have some buffer for technical snafus, chatting before we hit record, etc.

During the recording, all you have to do is talk! It is my job to set you up for success, keep us on track, and watch the time.

Step 4: After the recording 😎
=============================

I will edit the episode and write the show notes. After the episode goes live, we high five each other for a job well done and promote the episode on social media!
