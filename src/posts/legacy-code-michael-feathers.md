Michael Feathers, the author of the super-popular book “working effectively with legacy code”, talks about how systems are like living organisms. He is also the founder and director of R7K Research and Conveyance, a company that helps engineering teams with their software and organization design. Recently, Michael also joined Globant as Chief Architect.

**We talk about:**

- legacy code and how to deal with it
- how systems almost feel like living organisms
- how we are on a journey with our code, and why it’s so important to care for it,
- how legacy code is the result of an organization where engineers turn faster (leave the company/team) than the code churns.
