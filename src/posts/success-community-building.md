In this episode, I talk to Chris Biscardi, an independent software consultant about how he became successful through open source and community building.

**We talk about**

- how he niched down to only work with open source companies
- how he build the Party Corgi community by showing up and leading by example
- and what he thinks it takes to start your own successful software business in 2020.
