*Sponsoring Software Engineering Unlocked was fun and worth the investment! Working with Michaela is always great – she was very attentive to our advertising goals, spent time learning about our product, and spoke about us to her audience from a place of true authenticity. We saw real engagement after the ads and are excited to continue working with her in the future.  
-Tracy Phillips, Co-Founder at CodeSubmit*
