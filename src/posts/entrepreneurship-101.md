In this episode, I talk to Karls Hughes. Karl is a software engineer who turned into an entrepreneur in the midst of the pandemic last year. His start-up draft.dev creates content that reaches software engineers – which means he combined his two passions, development and content creation.

**We talk about:**

- his transition from developer to CTO, and then to the business owner,
- value-based pricing and how to focus on the customer segment that gets the most value out of your product,
- how to scale as a bootstrapped business,
- why blogging is such a career changer for developers.
