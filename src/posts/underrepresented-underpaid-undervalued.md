Jenn Creighton is a Senior Staff Engineer at Apollo. Jenn specialized in frontend-end development is currently working on the open-source work for Apollo GraphQL.  
She also is a frequent conference speaker, an authoritative voice in tech, and recently started her own podcast called single-threaded

**We talk about:**

- what a senior staff engineer does, and which responsibilities this title entail,
- why she needed to frequently change her job in order to advance her career,
- how gaslighting, bias, and being underrepresented, underpaid, undervalued is part of her decades long experience as a developer
- and how she makes sure she is helping others to enter tech and have a better experience.
