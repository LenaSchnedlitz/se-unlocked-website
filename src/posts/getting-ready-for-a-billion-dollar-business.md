Max Stoiber is a JavaScript Engineer that is in love with React and Node, and also a fellow Austrian. He has a track record in the open-source world, worked for Gatsby, and Github, and also is a successful entrepreneur.

**We talk about:**

- what he learned about software engineering best practices at GitHub,
- why he started his newest side-project bedrock,
- why building an indie or small lifestyle businesses is not his thing anymore,
- and how he prepares to build a billion-dollar business.
