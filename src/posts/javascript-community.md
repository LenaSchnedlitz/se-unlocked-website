Tracy Lee, the CEO and co-founder of This Dot Labs, talks about starting and running a widely successful dev shop. She is also a speaker, conference organizer, and blogger.

**We talk about:**

- how she dared to start her first start-up as soon as right out of college,
- how she learned to program and fall in love with JavaScript and the community,
- how she founded a successful development shop,
- her advice in terms of a marketing-driven versus product-driven startup launch.
